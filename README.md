When we talk about formulating proclamation, manifesto, theories, ideas etc, what common pattern of problem solving do we see?
Are such problem solving methodolgies equally implemented when it comes to solving difficult problems distinct to women?
There will some factors that will serve as barriers to problem solving distinct to women, others will limit the discussion completely, how do we
find the balance between the two?
Many people and nations talk about freedom of speech(FOS) and power of human mind, but is human potential with FOS truly utilized to solve 
the most complex issues?

Many countries policies or philosophies develop out of "when do any  nation figure out there is too much FOS, thinking or exploration?", 
possibilities are:

-Strict restrictions to FOS.

-Have FOS but can't talk about certain people or issues.

-Have FOS, can talk about anything but there is a point where no further exploration of issues is allowed even when they are extremely 
beneficial to solve the difficult problems.

-Have FOS but is awarded as a gift or favor.

-FOS is promoted for self gain not for the sake of FOS.

-FOS is widely circulated and encouraged, ideas are collected but they never make it to where it should reach.

-FOS but only in the name, nothing passes far from current set of thinking ideals or current leaders.

-FOS is a tool to make people think they have freedom but is used to distract people from urgent issues of humanity.


So the question is which nation restrict FOS, allow FOS or FOS is infinitely allowed but is suppressed or never allowed to be implemented in ways who make use of FOS think they have freedom but all they have is a distraction ?

Next time ask yourself what's better?
FOS with no outcomes at all, just in the name or no FOS!
